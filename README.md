# NASA API Challenge for Shopify Internship 2022

### What will you find in this page?

I was able to make a rudimentary API call to NASA's A Photo of the Day API. I have just begun learning how to program, so I wasn't able to create a complex webpage. I have a date picker in the page, but I wasn't able to find a way to refresh the page on the new date clicked. You will find that you can reload the page after changing the date and getting that new data loaded on. 

A couple of things that I would like to work on in this webpage is finding a way to reload the page on-click, and a way to display more than one image at a time. 

Thank you for taking the time to look at my work :) -Ivan
